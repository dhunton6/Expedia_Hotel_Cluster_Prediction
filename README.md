# Description
Online travel agencies are scrambling to meet the artificial intelligence driven personalization standard set by companies like Amazon and Netflix. In addition, the world of online travel has become a highly competitive space where brands try to capture our attention (and wallet) with recommending, comparing, matching, and sharing. This project attempts to predict which “hotel cluster” the user is likely to book, given his (or her) search details.
   
Note that this project was assigned early in Predictive Analytics, and the goal was simply to get a look at a few predictive models. Any result over 10% accurate was considered very good.
